## Build shopping dictionary and data engineering Project

### Good basic data brings good results!!
Developers with the ability to create good data in big databases.

- main skill : hadoop, pyspark, python, shell, hive, ElasticSearch
- version : python3.9, pyspark3.3.2, hadoop3.3.4, (airflow, jenkins)

### Purpose and Direction
+ Generate high-quality foundational (training) data (by Data Engineering)
  + Lead development based on NLP-driven hypothesis formulation
  + Train to understand data correlations and characteristics
  + Acquire AI/ML knowledge and practice for model training
  + Explore stable platform construction and operation (Hadoop, Python, Spark, Hive, etc.)
  + Develop data for search purposes (including recommendations)

### Technical Skills
+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  + Build attribute dictionaries (e.g., for units and measurements)
  + Extract internal keywords for search (inner keywords)
  + Cosine Similarity
  + Jaccard Similarity: for recommended keywords, related products, and associated terms
  + Noisy Channel Model: typo â†” correct term mapping dictionary, extract category-based similar words (get noise keywords, stopwords)
  + TF-IDF
  + Word2Vec (using Skip-gram & CBOW)
  + N-gram (with liked prediction)
  + One-hot encoding
  + Integer encoding
